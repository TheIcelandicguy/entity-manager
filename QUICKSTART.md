## Tips & Tricks

💡 **Remember**: Entities disabled by integration default show "disabled by: integration"

💡 **Pro Tip**: Use search to find entities by type (sensor, binary_sensor, etc.)

💡 **Time Saver**: "Enable All" works at both integration and device level

💡 **Stay Organized**: Only enable diagnostic entities you actually monitor
